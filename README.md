Exploratory data analysis on factors influencing acceptance of coupons by drivers en route to a destination.


**Dataset:** 
This dataset, obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, was collected via a survey conducted on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The survey outlines various driving scenarios, including details such as destination, time of day, weather conditions, and passengers, and records respondents' decisions on whether they would accept a coupon while acting as the driver.

**Objective:** 
The objective is to conduct a detailed exploratory data analysis to understand which coupons are more frequently accepted or rejected across various driving scenarios. This will involve studying the scenarios through visualizations to uncover patterns and insights.
